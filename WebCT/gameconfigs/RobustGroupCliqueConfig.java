/**
 * This configuration implements much of the setup and functionality.
 * Including automatic exchange after accept an offer, and automatic movement.
  The game configuration file RobustGroupCliqueConfig.java located in
the gameconfigs directory describes an alternating-phase
minimal-information CT game that can be played with an arbitrary
number of players on an arbitrarily-sized board. (By default, it is
set up for use by 3 players on a 6x6 board, but it is a simple task to
change these numbers.) The goal of the game is to collect as many gold
chips as possible; gold chips are acquired through successful exchange
interactions (success being defined in this game as the formation of a
clique). Each turn, the game alternates between a movement phase and
an exchange phase.

In each movement phase, every player is given some pre-set number
chips that allow them to move a corresponding number of spaces across
the board. Players can move in any direction they wish, as movement is
uninhibited. However, the movements of other players are hidden
locally, and only revealed at the end of each movement phase.

In the exchange phase, each player is given some fixed number of white
chips. They are then free to distribute these white chips to other
players in any manner they wish. (There is also a commented-out
section of code that allows players to hold white chips they do not
wish to distribute.) The game keeps track of all transactions and
creates an "exchange graph" out of these logged interactions. It then
looks for cliques on the graph, and then gives a bonus to players who
are members of these cliques (larger bonuses are conferred to players
who contribute more).

Then it is time for the movement phase again, and the game loops
through these two phases some predetermined number of times. Finally,
the game enters into a 10 second "feedback phase" before ending
entirely.
