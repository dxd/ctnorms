A game configuration file is a java source file where you define the logic of your game. An introduction to building game configuration files is found in Configuration_Class_HOWTO.pdf. Look also at the sample code in 'gameconfigs'.

Older CT3 documentation is found in the folder Older_Documentation. The documents in this folder are not longer up-to-date and much about the codebase has changed; nevertheless, they are still useful to get a general idea of what CT is and how it operates.

To learn about writing your own agent code, look at the sample code in 'agents'.

To learn about how our GUIs are constructed, look at the code in 'gui/ctgui/original'.

If your game requires support code that does not naturally fit in our established categories, then you can put that code in the package ctexpsupport. We recommend putting your code in a subpackage: 'ctexpsupport.mycode'. The source any support code is located in the directory 'experiment-support/ctexpsupport'.
